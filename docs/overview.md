# SYSTEM OVERVIEW

## What is Zanistarast?

Zanistarast is a unified scientific framework describing:

- dimensional emergence
- geological evolution
- biological transition
- mind formation
- ethical structuring
- civilization stabilization
- unified time integration

The system treats each theory as a modular scientific layer.

## Core Principle

Reality evolves through progressive dimensional transitions:

DIMENSION → LIFE → MIND → ETHICS → CIVILIZATION → STABILITY

---

## System Structure

1. Foundational Dimensions
2. Evolutionary Transition Models
3. Cognitive Expansion
4. Moral Structuring
5. Civilizational Equilibrium
6. Unified Field Integration
7. Time Theory Extension

## Purpose

This framework aims to provide:

- interdisciplinary synthesis
- long-term civilization models
- entropy-driven transformation analysis
