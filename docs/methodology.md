# METHODOLOGY

## Scientific Approach

Zanistarast uses a layered synthesis methodology:

1. Conceptual Modeling
2. Evolutionary Sequencing
3. Dimensional Mapping
4. Collapse Analysis
5. Stabilization Modeling

---

## Research Logic

Each theory follows:

Observation → Model → Transition → Testability → Integration

---

## Framework Design

The system is designed as:

- modular
- expandable
- self-consistent
- cross-dimensional

---

## Validation Principle

Models are evaluated through:

- logical consistency
- dimensional continuity
- entropy behavior
- system stability
