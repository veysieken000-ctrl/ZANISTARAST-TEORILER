# 07 — Geological Limit and Transition to Biological Phase

## 1. Geological Expansion Principle

According to Zanistarast science, the geological era is the phase where physical structures dominate evolution.

Expansion occurs through:

- matter accumulation
- planetary cooling
- structural stabilization
- environment formation

Goal of this phase:

> Preparation of a stable stage for biological emergence.

## 2. Geological Limit (Critical Boundary)

Geological systems cannot expand infinitely.

Three limitation laws appear:

1. Energy distribution limit
2. Structural stability threshold
3. Complexity saturation

When these limits are reached:

- further physical growth loses efficiency
- system enters instability

This defines the Geological Limit.

## 3. Compression Before Transition

At the limit, evolution does not stop.

Instead:

- expansion slows
- systems compress internally
- energy reorganizes toward complexity

This is the transition pressure phase.

## 4. Emergence Condition for Biology

Biological phase begins when:

Physical order + Environmental stability + Energy cycling

reach a balanced structure.

Formula (conceptual):

G_limit → E_balance → Bio_opening

---

## 5. Transition Law (Zanistarast Interpretation)

The universe does not jump randomly between phases.

Transition rule:

Lower dimension prepares environment  
→ Higher dimension activates function.

Therefore:

Geological phase prepares  
Biological phase activates.

---

## 6. Core Transition Indicators

Indicators showing biological opening:

- chemical recursion
- self-repair structures
- adaptive patterns
- replication tendency

These signals indicate the end of pure geology.

---

## 7. Result

Geological phase ends not by destruction but by transformation.

Geology becomes infrastructure.

Biology becomes active engine.

This transition creates the first dimensional ascent in evolutionary history.

---

## 8. Zanistarast Synthesis

Physical expansion alone cannot sustain evolution.

Life is the natural continuation of geological stabilization.

Thus:

Matter → Environment → Life

is the first universal chain.
