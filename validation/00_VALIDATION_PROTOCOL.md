# VALIDATION PROTOCOL

## PURPOSE

Defines how Zanistarast theories are evaluated for consistency and stability.

---

## VALIDATION TYPES

1. Logical Consistency
2. Structural Continuity
3. Cross-Theory Compatibility
4. Collapse Resistance
5. Predictive Stability

---

## VALIDATION FLOW

AXIOMS → THEORY → SYSTEM → ENGINE → CIVILIZATION MODEL

---

## TEST CONDITIONS

- entropy pressure
- dimensional transition
- ethical instability
- systemic collapse scenarios

---

## RESULT

A theory is considered valid when it maintains stability across all layers.
