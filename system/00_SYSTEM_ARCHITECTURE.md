# ZANISTARAST SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

## SYSTEM STATE
ACTIVE RESEARCH FRAMEWORK

---

## STRUCTURE FLOW

DIMENSION → GEOLOGY → BIOLOGY → MIND → ETHICS → CIVILIZATION → TIME → UNIFIED FIELD

---

## MAIN COMPONENTS

- Theory Blocks
- Axiom System
- Unified Equations
- Stabilization Engine
- Time Theory Integration
